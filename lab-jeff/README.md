## **README**

#### **Description**
This package includes standalone map, filter, reduce, concat, and splice functions using call and apply. It also includes a CLI index.js that uses the map function to upper case all command line args and print them to the screen. The fp-test.js module tests the functions to ensure they are working properly.
